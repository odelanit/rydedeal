rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules
(collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
Agreement.&nbsp; For information on the AAA, please visit its website,

disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.&nbsp; If there is any inconsistency
between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement,
the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.&nbsp; The
arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court
would.&nbsp; All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not
limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of
this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; Although arbitration proceedings are usually
simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable
law.&nbsp; Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span></p>

                <p><span>Unless RYDEDEAL and you agree otherwise, any
arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for
both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other
pertinent circumstances.&nbsp; If the parties are unable to agree on a
location, the determination shall be made by AAA.&nbsp; If your claim is for $10,000
or less, RYDEDEAL agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through
a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
Rules.&nbsp; If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
determined by the AAA Rules.&nbsp; Regardless of the manner in which the
arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
the award is based.</span></p>

                <p><span>Payment of all filing, administration, and
arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the
AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; If the
value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, RYDEDEAL will
pay all Arbitration Fees.&nbsp; If the value of relief sought is more than
$75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are
economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the
arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required
to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, RYDEDEAL will pay your portion of
such fees.&nbsp; In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the
costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, RYDEDEAL will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator
deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.&nbsp;
Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</span></p>

that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified.&nbsp; If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions
of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety
of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions
are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for
public injunctive relief.&nbsp; The remainder of the Terms of Service will

                <p><span>These Terms of Service constitute the entire
agreement between you and RYDEDEAL and govern your use of the Service,
superseding any prior agreements between you and RYDEDEAL with respect to the
Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may
apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or
third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of
the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With
respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
above, you and RYDEDEAL agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco
County, California. The failure of RYDEDEAL to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right
or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in
the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in
full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such
claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this
agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in
judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement
to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You
may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of RYDEDEAL,
but RYDEDEAL may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part,
without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be
made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to
you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices
or links to notices generally on the Service.</span></p>
